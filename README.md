# Introduction
Human pose estimation deeply relies on **visual clues** and **constraint clues between parts** to locate keypoints. Most existing CNN-based methods do well in visual representation, however, lacking in the ability to explicitly learn the constraint relationships between keypoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Token representation for human Pose estimation (TokenPose).

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
- We propose to use tokens to represent each keypoint entity. In this way, **visual cue learning** and **constraint cue learning** are explicitly incorporated into a unified framework.

- Both **hybrid** and **pure Transformer-based** architectures are explored in this work. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed TokenPose-T is the first pure Transformer-based model for 2D human pose estimation.

- We conduct experiments over two widely-used benchmark datasets: COCO keypoint detection dataset and MPII Human Pose dataset. TokenPose achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance with much fewer parameters and computation cost compared with existing CNN-based counterparts.
